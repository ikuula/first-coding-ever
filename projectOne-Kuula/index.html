      <br>
        
        <p class="intro"> I'm Isaac! I'm 26 years old, married for two years, and a VCD major here at EWU. I'll be graduating in the spring and am pumped to see where I end up next. Currently I'm working at <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=dutch bros spokane downtown&tbs=lf_msr:-1,lf_pl:-1,lf_od:-1,lf_oh:-1,lf:1,lf_ui:3,lf_pqs:EAE&safe=off&rflfq=1&rlha=0&rllag=47662282,-117414663,884&tbm=lcl&rldimm=16774970252614131700">Dutch Bros Coffee</a> in downtown Spokane, and am a manager/trainer. I've made coffee for a really long time, but life is still good. 
          <br><br>
          I went back to school because I realized that if I'm not being creative in some sort of way then I get pretty burnt out on life. I'm not sure where design is going to take me, but I'm eager to try new things and find my niche. Currently my favorite creative outlets outside of design are customizing and fixing up old motorcyles, working on our house, and playing music at church. As long as I'm making/creating something I'm usually pretty stoked on it.
          <br><br>
          As far as goals and aspirations go, I'm pretty open. Right now I'd really just like to get my foot in the door somewhere. I know paying your dues and pushing pixels is something that alot of designers start out with, and I'm ok with that at first. experience is valuable, even when it's not the most exciting thing. Long term, however, I would love to be working in a creative firm or possible a magazine of some sort doing creative and art direction. Basically I'm just hoping my path falls more on the fun, creative, and imaginative side of design.

     <br><br> I'm not really sure if this is my favorite book or not, but it's the one that I've read the most times. "The Hobbit" is the first novel that I remember reading, and since then I've returned to this adventurous tale a handful of times over the years.
